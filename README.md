# Files Inside
List all the files inside a folder with a specific extension

### Usage
To work properly, you have to create a configuration.txt file in the same directory of the script with this specific template:
```
  path
  extension
```
An example of a valid configuration.txt is:
```
  C:/Users/Octocat/Desktop
  .py
```
